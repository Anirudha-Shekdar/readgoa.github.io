    <h1>How To Reach Goa ?</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>1. By Air</h2>
    <p class="para1">
      Being a popular tourist destination and an unwinding spot, Goa is well
      connected to all the major cities in the country by air. You can avail
      regular flights to this tropical paradise from cities like New Delhi,
      Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi and Chennai. However, the fastest way
      to reach Goa is to take a flight from Chhatrapati Shivaji International
      Airport in Mumbai which takes approximately an hour to reach. <br /><br />
      The Dabolim Airport in Goa is located around 26 kilometres from its
      capital city; Panaji. As the tourist season arrives, this aerodrome also
      receives international flights even though it is mainly served by domestic
      airlines. The airport also provides currency exchange, prepaid taxi
      counter and ATMs along with the basic amenities. To keep you busy as you
      await your flight, the airport also has food joints and shopping centres
      within its premises. People travelling internationally usually fly into
      major cities such as Delhi and Mumbai and then transit into a domestic
      flight with airlines such as Jet Airways, IndiGo, SpiceJet or Air India.
      <br /><br />
      There are also a few Russian, German and British charter companies that
      offer direct flights to the Dabolim Airport during the months of November
      to February.
      <br /><br />
      It would be advisable to book your tickets well in advance, especially if
      you are travelling in the peak season. Goa is packed during the summer and
      the New Year season. Hence, make sure you book your tickets and
      accommodation well before time to get cheap deals.
      <br /><br />
      Air India is identified as the national carrier and also the safest
      airline to the destination. However, one can choose between any of the
      following airlines to travel to Goa - Jet Airways, SpiceJet, IndiGo and
      Vistara. Upon arrival, individuals can avail of the bus taxi or hotel
      shuttle to reach their required destination.

    <h2>2. By Railways</h2>
    <p class="para1">
      The long Konkan Railway deemed to be 760 kilometres stretches all the way
      from Mumbai to the north and Mangalore to the south. However, Margao’s
      Madgaon Railway Station is the biggest station and strongly linked to
      other parts of the country through a vast train network. Regular trains
      run from Delhi to Madgaon, the important ones being Goa Sampark Kranti
      Express and Trivandrum Express. The Madgaon Railway Station is located
      approximately 38 kilometres from the capital city. Another railway station
      is the Vasco da Gama station that is 29 kilometres away. Taxis will be
      available as soon as you make your way out of the station. The rail is a
      rather inexpensive way to travel and you will reach your destination in
      approximately six hours and 24 minutes. With the main railway station
      being in Madgaon, which is North Goa; try to take a train that stops at
      Thivim if you plan to travel to the North Goa beaches like Anjuna, Baga,
      Calangute, etc. Travelling to Goa by train is a treat to one’s eyes as the
      scenic locations and lush green trees whiz past you.

    <h2>3. By Roads</h2>
    <p class="para1">
      Ever since we have watched Dil Chahta Hai, a road trip to Goa has been on
      our bucket list. Hire a car and drive down to this beach paradise as the
      salty smell of the sea fills your senses and scenic locations rush past
      you. The easiest way to travel by road is from Mumbai which is just
      fourteen hours away. The fastest route however from Mumbai is via National
      Highway 4, which takes you from the Mumbai – Pune Expressway to Belgaum
      and then to Goa. State and private buses also run to and from Goa to
      various cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Hampi. However, we
      suggest you take the train instead of the bus because of the unpredictable
      traffic.

    <h2>4. By Seas</h2>
    <p class="para1">
      For all the water babies out there, cruise ships coming from the UAE and
      travelling between Mumbai and Maldives are available. However, if you are
      travelling from Mumbai and want to stay amidst the water for a while, a
      new cruise ferry service functioning between Mumbai and Goa will be there
      at your beck and call. Known as Angriya Cruises, this is a one-day journey
      reputed to be an overnight pleasure. It comprises two restaurants, a spa
      and an infinity pool. The ship sets sail from Mumbai’s Victoria Docks at
      4pm every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and reaches Goa’s Mormugao cruise
      terminal at nine in the morning the following day. The service functions
      from October to May and online bookings open one month in advance. Hence,
      make sure that you book your tickets well before time.
