        <p> If you are heading to Goa for the first time, or the 50th time, this list is for you. With restaurants like Martin’s that have been around for decades, to the new kids on the block like Tamil Table, and those like Gunpowder are just unmissable, here’s the Ultimate Guide To Restaurants In Goa, across all cuisines, budgets and locations.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><h3>Bomras</h3></li>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="bo.jpeg" style='width: 100%'>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="bom.jpeg" style="width: 100%">

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>This wildly popular outpost (now) in Anjuna, serving all manner of experimental Asian fare, with ingredients grown in their backyard and/ or locally sourced has acquired a cult following.</li>
                <li>Chef Bawmra Jap's inventive menu and a service staff who earned their stripes at The Bombay Canteen are what keeps this place running at full capacity every night of the week. </li>
                <li>Try their unique take on the slow-cooked goat leg with herb rice if you're there for lunch. But, if you can get a table, opt for dinner instead. Begin with a Rangoon Sour or Tamarind Dukshiri, and something simple like a plate of stir fried garden greens with smoked pork, and gently graze your way through newer dishes, such as the Grilled Kashmiri Morel (pictured above). </li>
                <li>do not miss the tender coconut pannacotta – and leave the uber-famous gelato from Cream Choc for another day.</li>
                <li>Cost: Rs 1,600 for 2, without alcohol</li>
                <li>Address: 1152, Mazal Waddo, Opposite Our Lady Of Health Chapel, Anjuna, Goa</li>
                <li>Ph: +919767591056</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><h3>Roboto</h3></li>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="ro.webp" style="width: 100%">

                </div>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>In a quieter street in Calangute sits this very new, very excellent little restaurant, where local produce makes its way into Japanese cuisine – into miso soups and gyoza and more. That is, you'll get everything but sushi at unique izakaya. </li>
                <li> Order up a gin cocktail – we'd recommend the Seijaku (gin with homemade sencha tea cordial) or even the simple but genius mix that is Bees and Flowers – and a few plates of some the delectable beef tataki (a must-try) and chashu pork belly, and settle in to savour the kawaii art all around you. </li>
                <li>Cost: Rs 1,000 for 2 (approx) without alcohol </li>
                <li>Address: 5/2, Naikawaddo, Near Dolphin Circle, Calangute, Goa</li>
                <li>Ph: +918010831200</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><h3>Pousada by the Beach</h3></li>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="p.jpeg" style="width: 100%">

                </div>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Pousada comes with the promise of stunning beach views, a relaxed vibe and spot-on seafood fare to compensate for the journey and time it takes to reach here. </li>
                <li>Their Fish in Banana Leaf is the star, but you’ll might also end up loving their Crusty Prawns, Konkan-flavoured rice and Prawn Balchao as well.</li>
                <li>Cost: ₹3000 onwards for two people (approx.) </li>
                <li>Address: Holiday Street, Gaura Vaddo, Calangute</li>
