    <h1>Best Time to visit</h1>

    <p class="para1">
      Goa is all about losing track of time. Where you donâ€™t know when the sun
      goes down and the stars come out as you dance the night away. The
      throbbing beaches and the cheerful outlook of the many tourists in Goa
      make you feel like something magical is always about to happen. Goa is in
      a constant state of excitement. A tropical paradise where night and day
      merge into a unending journey of relaxation and rejuvenation - almost like
      a party that everybody has been invited to. However, Goa is also about
      wandering away from the restless crowds and heading to quaint, unusual
      cafes to spend some time with yourself or a loved one. It is about
      stealing away moments and escaping the chatter of the many people around
      you. In short, Goa is both the calm and the chaos. <br /><br />
      Goa has many shades highlighted by its seasons. Which shade you want to
      witness, is totally your choice. We, at Thomas Cook, will make sure you
      make the right decision by helping you choose when to take the big step.
      Each season in Goa has something different to offer. Here, we have for you
      all the information that you may require in order to choose the most ideal
      time to travel. Listed for you are also the precautions that you must take
      before and while you are on your trip.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>

    <p class="para2">
      Perhaps the most famous of all Goan festivals, the Carnival is the epitome
      of celebrations in Goa. It is celebrated for three days and three nights
      and preceded by the month of Lent (February). Introduced by the Portuguese
      colonial rule in the 18th century, this festival is that time of the year
      when the legendary King Momo takes over the operations of the festivals
      and events. This event is worth witnessing in its mighty glory. It is one
      of the finest events in Goa.

    <p class="para2">
      Known for its excellent beaches and legendary nightlife, perhaps Goa is
      the best place to celebrate Christmas in India. With its Portuguese legacy
      and Catholic population, Christmas in Goa is celebrated with a gripping
      fervour. The churches and homes are decorated with beautiful lights and
      poinsettia flowers friends get together for a sumptuous meal. Children
      sing Christmas carol late into the night and people of all ages line up at

    <h3>4. Feast of Saint Francis Xavier</h3>

      This renowned festival in Goa is carried out to honour the death of Saint
      Xavier, popularly known as 'Goencho Saib' (Lord of Goa) by locals. He was
      a tremendous Catholic missionary born in 1507 and came to India with the
      Portuguese Viceroy of Goa in 1543. His primary task was to preach the
      religion of Christianity and the Gospel of Jesus to the people of Goa,
      Spice Islands, Japan and China among other Asian countries. He died on 2nd
      December 1552, in the Sancian island, about 10 kilometres from the
      mainland of China.
      <br /><br />
      As per popular legend, a group of Portuguese merchants performed his last
      rites and buried him in a coffin partly filled with unslaked lime. After a
      few months, a Jesuit (a member of the Society of Jesus) exhumed the body
      and was astonished to see that the corpse had not at all decomposed. It
      was further surprised when he cut a finger from the body and saw blood
      oozing out. Upon this discovery, Francis Xavier was conferred with the
      title of 'saint'.
      <br /><br />
      The mortal remains of the saint were placed in a silver casket in the
      Church of Bom Jesus (Basilica de Bom Jesus). However, one hand was cut off
      from the body- pieces of which were distributed to various parts of the
      world under the supervision of the Pope. Until 1994, Saint Xavier's body
      would be brought out every ten years on the anniversary of his death. The
      corpse would be kept in a glass case with the feet exposed. People from
      all over India and the world would visit the church to worship and catch a
      glimpse of the saint. After 1994, the body has not been brought for public
      display since the condition of the corpse had deteriorated significantly.
